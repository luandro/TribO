##About
>“Economy is about people not objects” Manfred Max-Neef

>“Swapping one thing directly for another while trying to get the best deal one can out of the transaction is, ordinarily, how one deals with people one doesn't care about and doesn't expect to see again” David Graeber

The famous communications theorist Marshall McLuhan once noted that with electronic communications, humanity would retribilize. Meaning that we would become less individualistic and go back to being community driven. Thus the famous term: global village. And this new form of social structuring will greatly effect the way we approach economic relations.

Together we create great abundance, but it is the difficulties brought by monetary relations of exchange  that cut our access to the plenty, thus creating scarcity.

Our system of economic relations was based mainly on the story of barter; a myth Adam Smith played a great role in spreading to such a point, it now became common sense. It is basically the old story we've all heard that before money people used to exchange 30 chickens for a cow. But, if you wanted to have a cow, your neighbor would have to want something you had, at the exact moment, and with the exact quantity that would equal to his cow. Wouldn't that be very difficult? Duh! That's why money was invented! Was it really?

Let me tell another version of the story. You want a cow, but your neighbor wants nothing you have at the moment. He simply gives you the cow, and you feel obligated to return the favor. Whenever you have something your neighbor wants, you give him, and slowly but surely you return what you received.

Now, what makes more sense? Creating an elaborate financial system to make possible for you to get your neighbor's cow, alienating the fact that you have social relations with him. Or simply accepting the cow as a gift and strengthening your social bonds?

The anthropological fact is that societies throughout history, and some still today, have used gift and communal exchanges more often than barter or financial relations. Then why did we stop? Well that's a long story, and you'll find in the Further understanding section a lot more you can learn about it.

All this was to give you a mild understanding on the idea behind this application.

##What is TribO?

**TribO is an economic manager**:  it helps give value to goods and services, and helps keep the balance of exchange inputs and outputs, and of haves and needs.

**TribO is a crowdsourcing platform**: it connects people. If you have a service to offer, it helps you connected to people who need it. And if you need goods, it helps you connected with people who offer it. If you have an idea, it helps you get the help you need.

**TribO is based on gift exchanges**: it expects users understand the principles of gift exchange. Goods and services have no numerical value. When you receive, you have the moral duty to give back, but not necessarily to the same individuals who gave you.

**TribO is based on Fundamental Human Needs**: its goal is to facilitate our needs being satisfied. Consumerism culture has been a master at making us desire what we don't need, but TribO's principle is to help us pursue needs before wants.

**TribO is about collaborative consumption**: if I have a set a power tools, there's not really a need for my neighbor to also have one. TribO makes it easy for people within communities to share their time, their skills and their resources with each other.

##What TribO is not

**TribO is NOT against businesses**: it's open for any institution to join the gift economy circle.

##Development

A development plan still needs to be drafted. For this projects, NodeJs along side mongoDB seem to be the best choices for creating an application suitable for scalability.
